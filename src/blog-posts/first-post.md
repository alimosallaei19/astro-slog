## Hey there!

Welcome to my first post on the blog. I will use this place to keep a running log of a lot of my projects, including changelogs for my public applications. Additionally, I will make sure to post a couple articles on my college applications process (maybe it helps the future high school seniors). 

For my blog's CMS, I used `Notion's API` to pull pages directly from a database and display them to you here. So now, here is a test of some of the styling options that Notion offers, and let's see if it transfers over!

1. This is #1 in a list
2. This is #2 in a list
3. This is #3 in a list

What about code blocks?

```jsx
var thisIsAwesome = () => {
	console.log('This is Awesome!')
}
```

And some equations? Like $v_f = v_0 + at$ and:

$$
x_f = x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

What about highlighting? And some cool blue highlighting? Lastly, let's look at this quote from **Julius Caesar** by William Shakespeare:

> If you must break the law, do it to seize power: in all other cases observe it.

Great, so everything seems to be working as it should! I want to give a big shout out to my friend [Ben Borgers](https://benborgers.com), who developed the Notion-to-HTML API this blog is using! Check out **Potion** on his website.

That's all for this post! See you guys in the later posts!
