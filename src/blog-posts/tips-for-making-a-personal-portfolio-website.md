### Yes.

Simple as that. Well I'm guessing if you opened this article, you're still debating whether or not to make a portfolio website for yourself. In all cases, **yes.** Do it! Now, you may ask "well, why?" Let me show you:

- **Web portfolios are becoming the new resume**. You may have had to use resumes, or even write one, in the past. That's exactly it; they're in the past. Gone are the days you need to carry around copies of your resume (do people do that even?). Now you can just give someone the link to your website and they'll know everything about you!
- **It's easy to make one.** Yeah, it is. It may seem daunting at first, but hopefully later on in this post you'll learn some tricks to make it easier.
- **It can show the real you.** Design your site in a way that shows people who you are! That's what is important.

### Ok ok, I'll make one. But, where do I start?

Well there are a lot of different places you can start at, but I suggest with first getting a domain. Even if you decide that you don't need a website, you can use your domain to host files you need to share, like PDFs or Slideshows. 

> ☝ I suggest using Google Domains for your domain. Dead-simple setup, and pretty cheap too!

Once you have a domain, it's time to connect it somewhere so that you can host your website, but, we need to decide first whether to make a **static website** or a **server generated website**. Personally, I preferred creating my website statically, as it was easier to edit and didn't require money, 'cause who has money these days, right? Right...?

Here's a look into how your website might be set up (in the backend) for each type. 

- Example setup of static website:
index.html
blog.html
about.html
assets
—> images 
—> styles
—> scripts
- Example setup of sever generated website:
*You would use a SGW framework, for example:*
—> React
—> Vue.JS
—> Next.JS
—> Astro

For SGW frameworks, there is a larger learning curve, however there is a bit more overall flexibility with the final product. If you feel like you're up for that challenge, go for it! Otherwise, static HTML is the better option in my opinion.

### OK, now what?

I won't go into depth on how to actually build your portfolio; you can use static HTML templates through Google searches if that's more to your style. However, for those who want to start from scratch, I have a couple hints for you:

1. **Host your site on [Github](http://github.com)**. Github is a nice little piece of software that keeps all of your code in a tidy place. But, it also has [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which you can use to host your statically generated portfolio! 
2. **Find a cool CSS framework you like.** CSS Frameworks (or styling frameworks) will save you TONS OF ⏲️ (trust me) when it comes to designing the actual look of your website. Creating components by hand is really hard, so why go through it when someone else has taken care of it already? My most favorite CSS framework is [Bulma](http://bulma.io) or Tailwind. They are very clean and complete styling frameworks that not only looks pretty, but also minimalistic (which is my style). Some others include Materialize, and Bootstrap.
3. **Keep your website clean.** Don't fill it to the brim with text and images, it will turn people away. Make sure to have a nice balance between text and spacing. Makes it easier on the eyes. 

Now this isn't the end! I'll probably keep adding to this post in the future, so keep an eye out! I love getting emails by the way, so if you're interested in reaching out to ask for help, or just to show me your work, shoot me an email at [ali@mosallaei.com](mailto:ali@mosallaei.com)!
