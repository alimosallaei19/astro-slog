### The first part of a series.

In this article, I am going to introduce my college applications process and give some updates on how it is going so far. 

Currently, I am a High School Senior, and since August 1st, 2021 I have begun the college admissions process. Here is an (incomprehensive) list of colleges I am applying to:

- **Early Decision:** Cornell University [Ithaca, NY]
- **Early Action:** California Institute of Technology [Pasadena, CA]
- **Early Action:** Northeastern University [Boston, MA]

> *Note: I do not yet feel quite ready to share my full list of colleges, however once I get back a few decisions letters, I will update the list below.*

### College Lists!

My finalized list of colleges includes **15 total colleges** that I will be submitting applications to, all located within the United States. An interesting thing I found out while developing my list was that all of my schools are either located on the east or west coast, none in the mid-west. 

If you are starting/close to starting the college admissions process, I *highly suggest* starting as early as possible in terms of making a list of colleges! Even if it is not a finalized list, it's good to get an idea of where you want to apply. I had a friend who finalized their list just a few days ago, which set them a bit behind on their process. It's a great idea to have a list ready to go when the time comes, just a thought ðŸ¤”.

I suggest using Notion to help plan out your college list. Later on, I'll post a link to my list here. Keep an eye out!

### Progress

Ok, now onto the actual meat of my progress so far. Let's review what I've completed so far, and what I'm working on:

1. **CommonApp Essay:** Still a WIP. Well, in all honesty, the *current* topic I have is the 5th iteration of the CommonApp essay. The one thing they don't tell you about this process is how *taxing* it is in relation to the essays. Trying to make it unique while also compelling takes time, so don't give up!
2. **Supplemental Applications:** 6 completed / 8 needed for November 1st deadline. Here's a really important note: I was lucky to get 6 schools completed by now, only because I started **really early!** By really early, I mean I started drafting my essays when the CommonApp opened on August 1st. I highly suggest setting aside the month of August before your senior year to work on the CommonApp/College Application process.
3. **Financial Aid Stuff**: Still not open! [Opens October 1st]
4. **Standardized Testing:** Taking the SAT on October 2nd, 2021. Let's hope!

Alright, well this concludes this update. Today marks roughly 1/7 of the entire college applications process completed. Still another 6/7 left, but hey we'll get through it! 

I'm always open to talking more about my list, so get in touch with me through email at [ali@mosallaei.com](mailto:ali@mosallaei.com). Thanks for reading!
