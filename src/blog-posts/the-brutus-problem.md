### Physics has definitely been a struggle.

As you may (or may not) already know, I am a current senior at Lexington High School, and this is the year where my science class is the (truly amazing) Physics class! The short of it is that physics can get really challenging at times; having to remember the many different formulas, equations and concepts. 

A couple of my friends and I, sharing the same Physics and British Literature class, out of both boredom, interest and pure ~~chaos~~ fun developed our own Physics problem. We had just finished our *Julius Caesar* unit in English and the Circular Motion unit in Physics, but beware: this problem is currently not solvable due to its…well…interesting properties. We present to you, the Brutus Problem.

### The Context

Brutus (one of Julius Caesar’s right hand men) is trying to play a game of chess with a Shark. This chess game is like any other, except for the fact that the Rook is able to move in a circular path around the board, as many times as it wants and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 15.66 times greater than a Neutral Subaru. 

> ♟️ Although it is inconsequential to the problem, the Shark is playing the Black pieces.

This chess match is taking place on a boat, which is going at a velocity equal to 10 Newtons/Hour. An island, situated 40degrees south of east and 500 nautical miles away from the boat is traveling at a relative velocity of 1 mm/decade. After 2 hours of the chess match starting, The Shark is left with 2 pawns on squares A2 and C2, with the king residing on B1, while Brutus has his queen on B6 and a rook on A3. He had sacked his king early in the game.

> 🅰️ Here is the first question: What move should Brutus make to checkmate the Shark?

If you said `Rook to H1`, you got it right! As mentioned earlier, the rook is able to move in a circular direction around the board, so the move from A3 passes in a semicircular motion to D8, then completes its motion to H1. 

Now on this boat, there is a 4-way Atwood machine, in which Brutus, the Shark, and the island are connected to. Here is some information on Brutus and the Shark:

- Brutus weighs 100kg. He is wearing a metal suite of armor, which has a gravitational acceleration of $\frac{g}{2}$.
- The Shark weighs 14532kg. He has 32 teeth. Just so you know.

Thus we come to the crux of the problem: the question it asks. 

> 🚨 What is the radius of the boat's mast?

Good luck!
