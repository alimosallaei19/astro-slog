### Writing essays is hard.

From someone who has (to date) written over 20 college essays, just for the Early Admissions cycle, burnout is real. It feels like ages ago, but back in August 2021 when college applications had just opened, I felt like I could write out 2, maybe even 3 essays **every day.** Oh boy, was I wrong ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

At that rate, I could have finished all of my essays for *all of my schools.* But now it's October 24th, 2021, and I've only now just barely finished my essays for the Early Admissions cycle. Take this one line, for example, at the end of one of my supplemental essays:

*Collaboration isn't about becoming the smartest man in the room; it's about becoming the most effective leader in the room.*

That, itself, took more than **a day** to come up with. One whole day, just for that one line. But there is a lot riding on the essays, right? Of course it depends on the school, but the essays are **your time to shine**!

### OK, so how do I not burn out?

Do you want the easy answer, or the harder-yet-probably-just-as-easy answer?

- **Easy:** Overestimate the time it is going to take you to write essays. Whatever timeline first pops into your head, *double* that. Now, you may find that you don't require that much time, but trust me, if you tell yourself that you will finish your essays in 2 months rather than 1 month, you **will plan better**!
- **Hard:** Write about something you love. Something that represents the real you. Here's a good metric: if you are spending more than 1 hour on just a draft of 100 words, then you might consider changing your topic! As humans, we tend to be more expressive when it comes to something we are passionate about, so definitely aim for that!

The best advice I can give you is to *just keep writing!* I can't remember a single day I didn't at least take a look at my essays in the last two months. Always keep your eyes fresh, and if you get stuck, start on another essay!

> üí≠ Here's a tip from journalists at the New York Times: if you ever get stuck on the wording of something, type the letters **TK**, which stand for "To [K]ontinue". Come back to that segment later with a refreshed look.

Lastly, and I don't think I can say this enough: everything will turn out OK! Essays are a big part of your application, that I won't deny. But they are also not the make-or-break of it! In a college virtual visit I went to for Cornell University, the admissions officer said:

> "A **strong essay** can be the tipping point for an applicant, but a weak one will just be another pin in a haystack. It won't hurt you, but it also won't help you stand out‚Äù

You want to be able to write an application where the admissions officer will want to fight for you to come to their school. You got this; just be yourself!
